# DES Soln Data Analysis

This repository contains the data analysis work done for DES Soln, a waste management platform focusing on India and Singapore Waste Management (IWM and SWM).

## Overview

The DES Soln Data Analysis project aims to analyze historical waste management data to provide insights and recommendations for optimizing waste management processes. By leveraging data analytics techniques, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in waste management practices.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze historical waste management data to understand trends and patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis to identify correlations and relationships between different variables.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps to communicate insights effectively.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build predictive models to forecast future waste generation and recycling rates.
- **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for improving waste management practices based on data analysis findings.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the raw data files are stored in the `data` directory.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests and analyses to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
5. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to present key findings and insights.
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms if applicable.
7. **Recommendations**: Summarize the key insights and recommendations derived from the analysis.

## Folder Structure

- **data/**: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks containing the data analysis code and results.
- **visualizations/**: Generated visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Python libraries for data analysis and visualization)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
